## Self-Intro
I am a third year undergraduate student at UCSB, studying Computer Science. I enjoy working on full-stack web development and I am excited to refine my interests through more experience.

My main hobbies are playing pickleball and poker, both introduced to me in the past two years or so.

## Project Ideas
- Restaurant picker for multiple users to decide on a restaurant
    - Users input their top 3 cuisines and cuisine with most votes is chosen (multiple if there is a tie)
    - Our app uses location to find matching restaurants and displays for user
    - Users can play mini game to choose one among the given choices
- Real time crowd status to determine availability of specific locations
    - Users who are already at a location can send updates
- Poker hand evaluator to determine if move was "correct"
    - Can teach users the ideal play and allow them to compare
    - Allow users to track their profits and losses and analyze their play
