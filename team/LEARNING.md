## Learning Plan

Given these strengths, we plan on pairing members who have experience in different areas on tasks with members who have less experience.

Our most significant gap in experience comes in the frontend.

Chloe: Will watch video tutorials on Svelte to close our gap in that area.\
Danny:\
Edison: Will read documentation on Express.\
Irene: Will watch tutorials on Svelte and leverage the knowledge for her GH issue.\
Karthik: Plans to read articles for Svelte and Node, will also try more SQL.\
Tanay: Will read DuckDB documentation and will ask Claude / Edison for help on SQL.\
Winston: Will read documentation and watch videos on Svelte\
