## Self-Intro
I'm a BS/MS student at UC Santa Barbara, and I focus on software + machine learning.

I want to work towards using these tools to do real good for humans. Recently, I've been exploring ML safety, robustness, and interpretability.

My hobbies currently include cooking and learning to play the guitar. 

## Project Ideas
- Browser extension to read foreign language information and provide
  information for language learners when hovering over words/phrases
	- Provide literal translation, actual meaning
	- Add option to add to Anki
- Optimizing credit card miles spent for a trip
    - Sort of like [AwardHacker](https://www.awardhacker.com/)
- Personal finance manager
	- Input CSV bank statements
	- Automatically categorize spending based on bank-provided transaction description
- Quantified Self: Time series forecasting with Apple Health data + journal + calendar, etc. Data dashboards, etc.
- A IOS habit tracker (mostly UI design heavy)
