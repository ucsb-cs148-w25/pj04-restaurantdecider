# Team Evaluation Response  

## Summary
### **UI Improvements**  
- The UI is pretty intuitive, but it could look better. Users want something more visually appealing.  
- Dynamic resizing of components would help—things feel a bit static right now.  
- Adding navigation buttons (like between search and ranking pages) would make moving around smoother.  

### **Functionality Enhancements**  
- After ranking, users want an easy way to go back—like a home screen button or something similar.  
- More info on restaurants would be great: descriptions, extra photos, etc.  
- Auto-location fetching would save users time—no one likes typing in their location manually.
- A “let fate decide” button could be fun for indecisive moments

### **Error Handling & User Flow**  
- Error messages during sign-up need work—especially when an account already exists. Make it clearer what’s going wrong.  
- Back buttons are a must for easier navigation within the app.  

### **Feature Additions**  
- Show recent or top-rated reviews alongside restaurant ratings—users want more context before deciding.  
- Let users search for restaurants by name instead of just filters or categories.  
- Group dining features? Like letting friends vote together to pick a spot. Could be cool for social outings.  

## Action Items 
Regarding the feedback we received for our USER_FEEDBACKS.md, we plan to improve our UI design so that the website doesn't look so empty and add more functionalities the users want (e.g. navigation buttons that makes it easier to navigate the web application and move back and forth on the website).

### **UI Improvements**  
- Sprucing up the UI/UX to make it more cohesive and polished overall.  

### **Functionality Enhancements**  
- Working on post-ranking navigation—users will get options to go back home or explore further after making selections.  

### **Additional Features**  
Additional decisions our team is making based on Form Section 2 (feedback on what users liked and what can be improved), we decided to add more restaurant details (photos, reviews, opening hours, etc.) so that users can better rank the restaurants that are presented. Users may not have seen the restaurants before and being able to peruse the menu and see past reviews can help them make a decision over which one they want to go to more. We plan to add these details on the back of the restaurant cards so that users can have all the information in one place.
- Exploring auto-location fetching and adding richer restaurant details (photos, reviews, etc.).  

### **Error Messaging**  
- Cleaning up error messages to make them clearer and more helpful during account creation and other interactions.
