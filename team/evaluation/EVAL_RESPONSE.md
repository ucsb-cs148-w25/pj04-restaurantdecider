# Team Evaluation Response  

## Summary
### **UI Improvements**  
- The UI is pretty intuitive, but it could look better. Users want something more visually appealing.  
- Dynamic resizing of components would help—things feel a bit static right now.  
- Adding navigation buttons (like between search and ranking pages) would make moving around smoother.  

### **Functionality Enhancements**  
- After ranking, users want an easy way to go back—like a home screen button or something similar.  
- More info on restaurants would be great: descriptions, extra photos, etc.  
- Auto-location fetching would save users time—no one likes typing in their location manually.
- A “let fate decide” button could be fun for indecisive moments

### **Error Handling & User Flow**  
- Error messages during sign-up need work—especially when an account already exists. Make it clearer what’s going wrong.  
- Back buttons are a must for easier navigation within the app.  

### **Feature Additions**  
- Show recent or top-rated reviews alongside restaurant ratings—users want more context before deciding.  
- Let users search for restaurants by name instead of just filters or categories.  
- Group dining features? Like letting friends vote together to pick a spot. Could be cool for social outings.
