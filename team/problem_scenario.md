# Problem Scenario

It's hard as a group to decide where to go out for a meal. Each person has
their own culinary and dietary preferences, and it's hard to find a place that
will accomodate everyone while also suiting their tastes. It's also difficult
to find places that are in a reasonable vicinity of the user.

Our goal is to develop a product that will track existing culinary preferences
and dietary restrictions of a group of users, and use this information to
synthesize a list of restaurants that will accomodate everyone in the group. We
will provide some algorithm that filters and ranks restaurants.

If the group cannot pick a restaurant, we will provide a feature that will
automatically select the most suitable restaurant.
