## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
    We used the heartbeat retrospective process and followed the "Start/Stop/Continue" template.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
    It went very efficiently and we were able to identify our major issues and address them.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
    Don't be afraid to speak.

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment: Our change/experiment was to communicate more outside of class and not only do project-related tasks during lecture or section.
  
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?): Our partner groups did meet up after class. This definitely sped up our project's progress, and we got a lot more functionalities incorporated into our product.
  
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change? We will continue to communicate and work together outside of class, since the three times we meet during the week are not enough.
