# Date of Retrospective: 02/14/25

* Led by: Danny You
* Present: Karthik Bhattaram, Irene Li, Winston Wang, Chloe Weng, Edison Zhang, Tanay Biradar (participated remotely)

## Action item

* a goal: Finish more issues and be more productive in class.
* a change/experiment: Stop wasting in class and create more issues to work on.
* a measurement: Number of issues finished.

## Start/Stop/Continues

* Start: Creating more issues and getting them done.
* Stop: Wasting class time and procrastinating.
* Continue: Communicate actively with other team members.

## Optional

* Team up with each other to spend class time effectively working on issues.

## Important Notes
* Make sure there's another option where the user doesn't have to do a ranking (may take too much time); create a ranking system that only shows the top choice and has no tie breakers
* How the team ranking is going to work: Since the scoreboard keeps track of each restaurant's score, add up all the people in the group's scores and rank the restaurants accordingly

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used. We used the heartbeat retrospective process and followed the "Start/Stop/Continue" template.
* A brief assessment of how it went. It went very efficiently and we were able to identify our major issues and address them.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today? Be brave to speak up.
## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment: The change is for everyone to start completing more issues (preferably in groups) and to meet up after class to work on these issues.
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?): Everyone did complete issues, and progress was made in the project, especially in the UI design and the restaruant search page. The pair groups worked together during and after class and were productive.
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change? We are going to keep the change and keep on making issues mostly pair groups so that issues are completed quicker and more progress is made in the project.
