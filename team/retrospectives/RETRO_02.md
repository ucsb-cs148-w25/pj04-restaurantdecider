* Stop: Wasting class time and procrastinating.
* Continue: Communicate actively with other team members.

## Optional

* Team up with each other to spend class time effectively working on issues.

## Important Notes
* Make sure there's another option where the user doesn't have to do a ranking (may take too much time); create a ranking system that only shows the top choice and has no tie breakers
* How the team ranking is going to work: Since the scoreboard keeps track of each restaurant's score, add up all the people in the group's scores and rank the restaurants accordingly

* A brief assessment of how it went. 
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment: 
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?): 
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
