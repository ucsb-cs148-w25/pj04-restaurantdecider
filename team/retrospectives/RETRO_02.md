## Action item

* a goal: Finish more issues and be more productive in class.
* a change/experiment: Stop wasting in class and create more issues to work on.
* a measurement: Number of issues finished.

## Start/Stop/Continues

* Start: Creating more issues and getting them done.
* Stop: Wasting class time and procrastinating.
* Continue: Communicate actively with other team members.

## Optional

* Team up with each other to spend class time effectively working on issues.

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used. We used the heartbeat retrospective process and followed the "Start/Stop/Continue" template.
* A brief assessment of how it went. It went very efficiently and we were able to identify our major issues and address them.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today? Be brave to speak up.

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment: Our change/experiment was to create more issues and work on those tasks during lecture or section.
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?): Our partner groups did meet up after class. This definitely sped up our project's progress, and we got a lot more functionalities incorporated into our product.
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change? We will continue to communicate and work together outside of class, since the three times we meet during the week are not enough.
