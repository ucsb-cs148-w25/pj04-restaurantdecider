## Meeting Notes

- Some team members still working on the Hello World project.
- Finalized with restaurant decider idea. 

Specifications from Irene:
> So the basic idea of the original project thing was a mobile app that allows a group of 2+ people decide where to go eat.
> Basically, the app will show each member a restaurant in their vicinity and everyone has to choose either yes or no and it keeps on going until we reach a unanimous agreement on one restaurant.
> For easier use, the users don't have to create an account and only have to activate a room (and other ppl join the room with a code).
> If they want, the users could also open up an account and save their favorite restaurants and rate them (and their ratings will show up when the group is choosing a restaurant).

We don't want to do mobile; it's hard to force users to download an app
We can use reactive web design to make a web app that is easy to use on mobile.
This reduces friction for users when using our product.

## Tech Stack
