## Meeting Notes

- restaurant cards on ranking page have been added, including opening hours, menu, directions, reviews, rating, etc.
- will implement a progress bar on the top of the ranking pages so users know how far they've progressed in the round
- make sure the users are not able to access any page in the web app unless they're signed in (if not signed in, automatically redirected to the sign in page)
- make sure users are not able to sign in if they haven't created an account before (or it ends up in the restaurant search button not working)
- continue researching how to implement group rankings
- prevent users from being able to go to ranking page if there aren't enough restaurants in the vicinity (or the bracket algorithm will crash)
- make sure the users have a way to go back to restaurant search page if they made an error (add a back button on the ranking page)
- add recent history rankings on the user's profile page
