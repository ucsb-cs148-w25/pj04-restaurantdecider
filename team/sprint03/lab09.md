    - tooltip feature for champion and bracket rounds
    - team rounds
    - sign in authentication (only when account is actually created, otherwise error)
    - prevention of going to ranking page if there aren't enough restaurants
    - improvement of profile page UI design
- next Monday: distribute the remaining issues and run through prod version to make sure there are no bugs
- most important issues yet to complete (high priority):
  - team rounds [IN PROGRESS]
  - sign in authentication (only when account is actually created, otherwise error) [IN PROGRESS]
  - not able to access other pages when not signed in (any attempt to go to another page like the ranking page will result in error and automatic directing to sign in page)
  - make sure 8/16/32 number of restaurants actually gets sent to the ranking pages
  - auto-location on Google maps
- lower priority issues (if time, can complete):
  - have a different home page for when the user signs in (no sign in button, individual and team buttons, sign out button) and when the user isn't signed in (sign in, sign up buttons)
  - progress bar on ranking rounds
  - dietary restrictions
  - do not show buttons (for restuarants to never show up in ranking)
  - favorite restaurants
  - adding a list and card view in the bracket final scoreboard so that users can see more information about the restaurants again
  - designing the home page more: adding some more information on the home page so users know how the website works and other about the website
