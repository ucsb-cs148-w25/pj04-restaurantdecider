# User Journey

User goes into a menu and inputs:
1. Location
2. Preferred distance
3. Dietary restrictions
4. Individual decision: Give samples of menus in restaurants, ask for user preferences
5. Group decision: Get a list of candidate restaurants. Get each person to Yes/No each restaurant and do a majority vote.

Value Exchange:
- User gets a list of restaurants that will accomodate everyone in the group.
